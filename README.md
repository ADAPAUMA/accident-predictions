# Accident Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of accidents using a machine learning-based approach. By analyzing historical data and various factors, the model provides insights to help reduce accidents and improve safety measures.

## Objectives
- To analyze historical accident data and identify key contributing factors.
- To develop a predictive model for accident occurrence.
- To provide actionable insights for safety improvements and decision-making.

## Methodology
The project involves:
1. Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and correlations.
3. Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict accidents.
4. Interpreting results and visualizing key insights.

## Dataset
The dataset includes [briefly describe dataset, e.g., "information about traffic, road conditions, weather, and time of the accidents."]  
**Note:** For detailed dataset information, refer to the notebook file.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the potential of machine learning in accident prediction. The model achieved [insert model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall] and identified [key insights, such as significant factors contributing to accidents]. These findings can be leveraged by policymakers and safety experts to reduce accident rates and enhance public safety.
